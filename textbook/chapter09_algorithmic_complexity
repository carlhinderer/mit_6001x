CHAPTER 9 - ALGORITHMIC COMPLEXITY
-------------------------------------------------

- The most straightforward solution is usually not the most efficient!  Computationally efficient
    algorithms often employ subtle tricks that make them difficult to understand.  

  There is a trade off between conceptual complexity and computational complexity.



- Complexity Classes

    O(1)             Constant Time
    O(log n)         Logarithmic Time
    O(n)             Linear Time
    O(n log n)       Log-linear Time
    O(n**k)          Polynomial Time (k is a constant)
    O(c**n)          Exponential Time (c is a constant)
