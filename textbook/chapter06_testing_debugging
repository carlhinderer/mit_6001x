CHAPTER 6 - TESTING AND DEBUGGING
-------------------------------------------------

- Bugs can be
    - Overt vs Covert
    - Persistent vs Intermittent

  Defensive Programming = try to write code in a way that makes bugs overt and persistent



- Glass-Box Testing Rules

    1. Exercise both branches of all 'if' statements

    2. Make sure that each 'except' clause is executed

    3. For each 'while' and 'for' loop, have test cases in which 
         - the body of the loop is not entered
         - the body is executed once
         - the body is executed more than once

    4. For recursive functions, have test cases which
         - make 0 recursive calls
         - make 1 recursive call
         - make more than 1 recursive calls
