- Turing Completeness

    - Alan Turing described a hypothetical machine called the 'Universal Turing Machine' in 1936

    - Church-Turing Theorem: 
        'If a function is computable, any Turing machine can be programmed to compute it.'

    - Not all problems have computational solutions.  For instance, Turing showed that it is 
        impossible to write a program P that will print 'true' if and only if P will run
        forever.  This is known as the 'halting problem'.

    - All modern languages are Turing-complete, so anything that can be written in one language
        can be written in any other language.
